GRAPH WITH 4 NODES 

4 vertices: [['A', [3, 19]], ['B', [4, 18]], ['C', [7, 4]], ['D', [12, 3]]]
2 edges : [['C', 'A'], ['B', 'D']]

Adjacency list: {'C': ['A'], 'A': ['C'], 'B': ['D'], 'D': ['B']}
This problem is not solvable, it has isolated vertices or it doens't require the conditions to execute the algorithm.
